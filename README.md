# DeepRMSA
For more details, see paper: DeepRMSA: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Routing, Modulation and Spectrum Assignment in Elastic Optical Networks (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8738827)

Run Deep_RMSA_A3C.py

K-SP-FF benchmark_NSFNET.py generates results for the KSF-FF and SP-FF algorithms

*.m files are used for generated precalculated routing information (if you want to apply the algorithm to a new topology)

Please contact xlichen@ucdavis.edu for any related question or concern.
